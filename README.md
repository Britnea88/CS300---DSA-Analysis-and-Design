# CS300---DSA-Analysis-and-Design
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Using different data structures and determining the best situations to use each of them.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
By situation and circumstance. Each data structure has strengths and weaknesses and have different roles to play in different types of projects.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by contacting my professor and utilizing online forums. By persistently searching for an answer or someone who might be able to explain the material, I was able to find solutions for any issues.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Learning about data structures and algorithms has broadened my perspective of what types of programming can be done in different fields. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This class showcased that the code for one project can be custom-fitted to different projects while still maintaining the core code. We created a vector, linked list, and hash table and we were able to use that code to help with the final project.
